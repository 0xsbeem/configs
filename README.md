# Installation

To install these scripts, run the install.fish script. Note that this script uses fish shell and assumes it is located in /usr/local/bin/fish (or that there is a symlink there to your fish execurtable). If you install fish but have it installed elsewhere, you could modify the script or just run `fish install.fish`
